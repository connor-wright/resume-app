        The goal of this project was to have a platform for recruters to easily acess.
        They can see my skills and abilities in a real world project and be able to contact me.
        This is a ruby on rails application hosted on heroku with a CI/CD pipeline on github. 
        The application is static but it does showcase my abilities with bootstrap html and css
        as well as some javascript.
